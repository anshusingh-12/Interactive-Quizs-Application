*OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*

In this task, I developed a web-based KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati) quiz game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game follows the format of the famous TV show, where players answer multiple-choice questions to win increasing prize amounts. The game ends if the player selects the wrong answer or if the timer runs out, awarding them the last secured prize.

*Tools and Technologies Used* :
HTML: Structured the game interface with different sections like the welcome screen, quiz area, and result screen.
CSS: Styled the interface with background images, animations, and responsive layouts to enhance user experience.
JavaScript: Implemented core game logic, including question handling, answer validation, timer functionality, and game progression.
Editor/Platform: Developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and tested using Google Chrome Developer Tools.

*Features Implemented*
User Login & Validation: The player must enter a username to start the game. If left empty, an error message is displayed.
Dynamic Question Loading: Questions are fetched from an array, displayed with four multiple-choice options, and change dynamically after each correct answer.
Timer System: Each question has a 30-second countdown. If time runs out, the game ends, and the player wins their last secured prize.
Game Progression: Players advance through 15 prize levels, with the winning amount updating dynamically.
Result Display & Restart Option: At the end of the game, the player's final earnings are displayed, with an option to restart the game.

**Applications of This Project**
Educational Platforms: Can be used for interactive learning and quizzes in schools and colleges.
Corporate Training: Useful for employee assessments and skill-based testing in companies.
Entertainment & Trivia Apps: Can be adapted into a full-fledged trivia gaming app.
TV Show Practice: Helpful for aspiring contestants preparing for quiz competitions like KBC.
Online Competitions & Gamification: Websites can use this format to engage users with fun quizzes and rewards.

*Conclusion*
This KBC Quiz Game is an excellent example of frontend web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates event handling, DOM manipulation, and game logic implementation. Future enhancements can include lifelines, sound effects, a leaderboard, and a database for storing scores. This project significantly strengthened my JavaScript skills and understanding of interactive web applications, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio. ðŸš€
